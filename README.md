It makes and documents architectural design decisions from the structural, behavioral and interaction point of view.First document the design decisions in a natural language (ie English) and then the informal model is converted to a more precise model.XCD is used official software architecture modeling language.It is expected to consider using architectural styles and confirm the choice of style.
